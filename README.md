## Overview

prime-rl is a framework for large-scale reinforcement learning. It is designed to be easy to use and hackable, yet capable of scaling to 1000+ GPUs. Here is what we think sets it apart:

1. Fully asynchronous RL for high-throughput agentic training at scale.
2. Performant: built to train 1T+ MoE models on 1000+ GPUs with [FSDP2](https://docs.pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/FSDP_tutorial.html) for training and [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) for inference, with FP8 inference, PD disaggregation, EP and CP parallelism, and more.
3. Native integration with [`verifiers`](https://github.com/PrimeIntellect-ai/verifiers) environments through the [Environments Hub](https://app.primeintellect.ai/dashboard/environments?ex_sort=most_stars), including built-in support for SWE and agentic environments.
4. End-to-end post-training: SFT, RL training, and evals.
5. Multi-node deployment with Slurm and Kubernetes support.
6. Multimodal support for VLMs such as Qwen3-VL.
7. Hackable, modular, and extensible by design.
8. One-line SLURM deployment for frontier models — e.g. [`GLM-5` FP8 with P/D disaggregation, the `llm-d` router, and Mooncake KV offload](examples/advanced/glm-5.2/).


## Models support


The trainer works with both Hugging Face and Prime custom `ModelForCausalLM` out of the box. For selected families (especially large MoE) we also ship highly optimized training code under `src/prime_rl/trainer/models/`, including expert parallelism (EP) for MoE layers and context parallelism (CP) for long sequences (see the table), and additional kernels like [quack-kernels](https://github.com/quack-kernels/quack-kernels).

With `[model] impl = "auto"` (the default), the trainer selects that custom stack when the Hugging Face config type is registered.

| Family | Example IDs | MoE | EP | CP |

| GLM-5 (`glm_moe_dsa`) | `zai-org/GLM-5`, `zai-org/GLM-5-FP8` | yes | ✅ | ✅ |

## Setup

> *We develop and test on NVIDIA RTX 3090/4090/5090, A100, H100, H200, and B200. If your setup fails, please create an [issue](https://github.com/PrimeIntellect-ai/prime-rl/issues).*

### Prerequisites

Currently, you **need at least one NVIDIA GPU to use prime-rl**. If you don't already have access to one, we recommend our [compute platform](https://app.primeintellect.ai) for everything from renting on-demand single GPUs for developing, debugging and small ablations, to [reserving 1000+ GPU clusters](https://app.primeintellect.ai/dashboard/quotes) for production-scale training.

### Quick Setup

Set up prime-rl in a single command.

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PrimeIntellect-ai/prime-rl/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

<details>
<summary>
Manual Setup
</summary>
<br>

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PrimeIntellect-ai/prime-rl.git
cd prime-rl
```

2. Initialize submodules

```bash
git submodule update --init -- deps/verifiers deps/renderers deps/research-environments deps/pydantic-config
```

3. Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
source $HOME/.local/bin/env
```

4. Install dependencies from the lock file

```bash
uv sync --all-extras
```

> *NOTE*: Environments are opt-in uv workspace members — `uv sync --all-extras` does not install them. To train on them, install all with `uv sync --all-extras --all-packages`, or a subset with `uv sync --package prime-rl --package <env>`.

4.1. On aarch64 hosts: build flash-attn from source for your GPU

> *NOTE*: aarch64 has no prebuilt flash-attn wheel. This step compiles the CUDA extension for your local GPU (~20-30 minutes). Compute capability is auto-detected from `nvidia-smi`; override with `TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST=9.0` (Hopper) / `10.0` (Blackwell) if needed.
> *NOTE*: After this step, you can't run `uv sync --all-extras` or `uv run` as it will uninstall the package, you can avoid it by running `uv sync --inexact` or `uv run --no-sync`.

```bash
bash scripts/docker-arm64-post-install.sh
```

3.1. Optional: Install Flash Attention 3 (on Hopper GPUs only, for flash_attention_3 attention backend)

> *NOTE*: This step will take a while, as it builds the Flash Attention 3 extension from source, as it has no wheels prebuilt.
> *NOTE*: After this step, you can't run `uv sync --all-extras` or `uv run` as it will uninstall the package, you can avoid it by running `uv sync --inexact` or `uv run --no-sync`

```bash
uv pip install "flash-attn-3 @ git+https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention.git@main#subdirectory=hopper" --no-build-isolation
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>
Validate your environment setup
</summary>
<br>

1. Check that the environment uses Python 3.12

```bash
uv run python -V
```

2. Check that `flash-attn` is installed

```bash
uv run python -c "import flash_attn"
```

3. Check that you can run SFT trainer  (*this requires 1 GPU*)

```bash
uv run sft @ configs/debug/fake/sft.toml
```

4. Check that you can run the RL trainer (*this requires 1 GPU*)

```bash
uv run trainer @ configs/debug/fake/rl.toml
```

5. Check that you can run the inference server (*this requires 1 GPU*)

```bash
uv run inference --model.name Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B
```

6. Check that the full RL stack (inference + orchestrator + trainer) runs end-to-end (*this requires 2 GPUs*)

```bash
uv run rl @ configs/basic/reverse-text/rl.toml
```

</details>

### Additional Setup

1. If you want to log your runs to [W&B](https://wandb.ai), log in

```bash
uv run wandb login
# Or set `export WANDB_API_KEY=...`
```

2. If you require gated/ private models or datasets from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co), log in

```bash
uv run hf auth login
# Or set `export HF_TOKEN=...`
```

## Training Examples
We provide end-to-end training examples in the [`examples`](examples) directory to highlight features of the framework and guide you through the process of training your own models.

Follow this guide to learn the basics of prime-rl. You can train your own models on 1 to 8 GPUs. Ideal for getting started and exploring the capabilities of the framework. These guides cover most use cases -- single-turn, multi-turn, tool calling, etc. -- on toy environments and small models.

1. [**Reverse Text**](examples/basic/reverse-text/README.md): Train `Qwen3-0.6B` to reverse a small chunk of text. Demonstrates tiny-scale single-turn SFT and RL training. Can be trained on a single consumer GPU in a few minutes, and is ideal for getting started.
2. [**Wordle**](examples/basic/wordle/README.md): Train `Qwen3-1.7B` to play Wordle. A fun example of multi-turn SFT and RL training. Can be trained on a 2-4 H100 GPUs in a few hours. Ideal for exploring the multi-turn training capabilities of the framework.
3. [**Alphabet Sort**](examples/basic/alphabet-sort/README.md): Train `Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507` to sort names alphabetically. Demonstrates multi-turn RL training via LoRA without SFT warmup. Can be trained on a single H100 GPU in just over an hour. Ideal for exploring LoRA-based training.
4. [**Wiki Search**](examples/basic/wiki-search/README.md): Train `Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507` to answer trivia questions by searching through a Wikipedia. Demonstrates multi-turn with web search tool use.
